# KompressAI

##Problem Statement
-Deploying large-scale AI models on low-power or embedded devices is a major challenge.

-These models require high computational power and large memory capacity.

-They often depend on continuous cloud access, limiting their use in remote or edge-based environments.

-This makes them unsuitable for cost-sensitive applications in industries such as agriculture, robotics, and healthcare.

-On-device intelligence is essential in these sectors for real-time decision-making and reliability.

-KompressAI addresses these challenges by enabling efficient and accessible AI model deployment.

-It directly supports Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9 by promoting innovation and fostering sustainable infrastructure.
